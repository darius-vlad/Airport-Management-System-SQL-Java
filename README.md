## Airport Employees Management System using MySql and Java

This application is for a project at University for the Databases subject. It is designed to be used for the employees of an airport.The application is based on a number of Sql querries that helps managing the employees at an airport. It can sort employees by function , by salary , select only the employees that meet a certain condition.
It also has a way of managing flights based on source and destination, on the total flight time , on the type of the aircraft.



## Tech Stack

**Database:** MySql

**User Interface:** JavaSwing


## Installation

The application is very easy to use. You just have to download the 3 files, open the java file and run it.
    
## How to Use?
The insertion and removal of employees from the database is strictly used only by the manager of the database.As a user you can press the log in button after inserting your credentials.
After that you will see a page containing all of the data. You can then go to the home page where you can select the desired operation.
## The Challenges
I came across some hard to build querries, that i eventually understood by breaking apart the requirement into smaller parts.
The connection to the database from java was clearly another hard part of this project as it was the first time trying it. Eventually i easily understood the logic behind the connectivity and the 
packages used for doing so.
